## ‚ú® Core Features

This application is packed with features that showcase a sophisticated, multi-faceted AI integration:

*   üé≠ **Dynamic Character System**: Don't just chat with one AI.
    *   Choose from a diverse roster of pre-built AI characters, each with a unique personality, voice, and backstory.
    *   Use the **Character Editor** to create, edit, and manage your own custom AI personas.
    *   Characters can be equipped with specific tools, allowing for specialized agents like a `Finance Manager` or a `Code Wizard`.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Tool-Augmented Agents**: In `Agent` mode, characters can leverage a set of tools to perform complex tasks beyond simple text responses:
    *   `search_web`: Performs real-time web searches for up-to-date information via the Tavily API.
    *   `calculator`: Evaluates mathematical expressions.
    *   `image_generator`: Creates images from text prompts and saves them locally.
    *   `add_transaction`, `get_financial_report`, `set_budget`: A suite of tools for the Finance Manager character.
*   üß† **AI-Powered Utilities**: The app includes several standalone, AI-driven screens:
    *   üí∞ **Finance Manager**: A dedicated screen for personal finance tracking with a beautiful UI, charts, and AI-powered description enhancement.
    *   üåê **Language Lab**: A powerful learning tool with a "Translate" mode for detailed grammatical analysis and a "Tutor" mode for conversational practice.
    *   üé® **Image Studio**: A specialized screen for generating images with fine-tuned control over styles, models, aspect ratios, and batch size.
*   üñºÔ∏è **Image Gallery**: A dedicated screen to browse, share, download, and delete all images created by the AI. Each image stores its original prompt and generation settings as metadata.
*   üíæ **Persistent State**: All conversations, characters, settings, financial data, and generated images are saved locally on your device using `AsyncStorage` and `expo-file-system`.
*   üöÄ **Modern UI/UX**: Built with React Navigation, the app features a clean, intuitive interface with:
    *   A new **Dashboard** home screen for quick access to all features.
    *   A slide-out drawer for navigation.
    *   Real-time typing indicators and AI "thinking" states.
    *   Smooth animations and haptic feedback.
    *   Full Markdown rendering for rich-text AI responses, including tables and images.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the AI Assistant running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version)
*   Git
*   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device.

### 2. Get Your API Keys

This app uses two external services and requires API keys for both to be fully functional.

1.  **Google AI API Key (Required)**
    *   This is essential for all core AI functionality.
    *   Visit the **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.
    *   Click **"Create API key"** and copy the generated key.

2.  **Tavily AI API Key (Optional)**
    *   This is required for the `search_web` tool used by some characters.
    *   Visit the **[Tavily AI Dashboard](https://app.tavily.com/)**.
    *   Sign up and copy your API key.

### 3. Clone & Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hasanraiyan/ai
cd ai

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

*   Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal with the **Expo Go** app on your phone.

### 5. Configure the App

1.  When the app first launches, a welcome modal may appear.
2.  Open the drawer menu (swipe from the left edge) and navigate to the **Settings** screen.
3.  In the "API Keys" section, paste the **Google AI Key** you obtained.
4.  Optionally, paste your **Tavily AI Key** to enable the web search tool.
5.  That's it! Navigate back to the "Dashboard", select a character, and explore the app's capabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Deep Dive

The **Settings** screen is your control center.

*   **API Keys**: Manage your keys for Google AI and Tavily. The app will gracefully handle missing keys by disabling the relevant features.
*   **Default AI Persona**: Modify the `System Prompt` to change the personality of the generic AI used for new chats started from the Dashboard's floating action button.
*   **Model Configuration**:
    *   **Main Chat Model**: The primary model for non-agent conversations.
    *   **Title Generation Model**: A typically smaller, faster model used to automatically name your chats.
    *   **Character Agent Model**: The model used by Characters for tool-based tasks. The app will indicate which tools are supported by your selected model.
*   **Danger Zone**: Be careful! Here you can permanently delete all your chat history, financial records, or generated images.
